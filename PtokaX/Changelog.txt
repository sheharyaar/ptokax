--------------------------------14.6.2002--------------------------------
New project, new experiences. After fights with WinSocket components i stay with TCP Server and test first session for visitors of PtokaX-CZECHPOINT hub.
My pleasure not have long time, because TCPServer component in trial version is limited to 10 connections, and i am very pissed off !!! <PPK>  "Aaaa bude sranda ;)"
Next 4 days i looking for good alternative.

--------------------------------May 2002--------------------------------
After my experienses with Neo-Modus Direct Connect Hub and with another available hubs for Windows i get opinion that is better to write new Hub working without problems with functions missing in another hubs. I start looking on internet and getting first informations on Direct Connect Protocol and network communication.
